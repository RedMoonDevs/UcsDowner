# UcsDowner
Proof of Concept to show that UCS (aka. Ultrapowa Clash Server) is vulnerable.

# Introduction
As you may or may not know, the development of UCS (ultrapowa clash server) is very unstable, and has come to the point where a lot of vulnerabilities can be found in the code. This UcsDowner is one of them

# What is it?
What if we told you we could down an UCS server in a matter of seconds? Unbelievable, right? 
But that's what we've done.

# How to use it?
Compile the source code using JDK1.8 and run it. 
Or you can download it in the release section.

# Usage
`java -jar UcsDowner.jar --ip="1.2.3.4"`
You may check the help that's going to show if you run the program without any argument.
